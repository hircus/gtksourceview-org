The Makefile contains the following target:

- install
  installs both the language definition and the MIME type

- install-lang
  installs the language definition only

- install-mime
  installs the MIME type only

By default the installation is private to the local user. To install
to system directories, invoke make as root with 'DESTDIR=${PREFIX}'
where PREFIX is /usr (for system packages), /usr/local (for locally
installed software) or any other prefix matching your GtkSourceView
installation.
